# Survival-Game

This Unity Project is my first attempt at a game development project, and my first step into C#. I worked on this independently aside from my school work. 
The player starts within a box, and they cannot leave. Enemies spawn at random locations and try to touch the player, it is the player's job to survive as long as possible. To increase score, the player may also collect gems. This game has background music, and a random audio effect plays when the player dies. 

A video demo for the game can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY99J-FbXdY&feature=youtu.be
